Substantial tariff hike on India in 24 hours: US President Donald Trump**
With New Delhi still looking to find ways to respond to the White House threats of increasing tariffs on Indian goods, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued a fresh warning saying he would raise tariffs “very substantially” over the next 24 hours because India is buying Russian oil. He termed India as not a good trading partner. About the trade deal with India that seemed imminent, Trump said the “sticking point” with India is that its tariffs are too high. Trump’s latest statement on the issue came hours after India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued a terse statement on Monday evening, where it termed the targeting by the US and the European Union for importing Russian crude unjustified and unreasonable. Until the Monday evening statement, Indian officials had said New Delhi did not want to publicly engage in a war of words with Trump, preferring to convey its perceptions to the White House behind closed doors. The developments in the past 24 hours have suggested a hardening of stands between the two countries. Addressing a public meeting in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged Indians to buy locally manufactured products.

अभी Result का सीजन चल रहा है तो कुछ बातें मैंने गौर की-**

✔️ यदि Stock बहुत अच्छे Result के बाद भी लगातार तेज़ी से गिर रहा हैं।

✔️ यदि Stock बहुत बुरे Result के बाद भी बहुत तेज़ी से बढ़ रहा हैं।

तो दोनों ही Conditions में मार्केट कुछ ऐसा जानता हैं जो हम नहीं जानते तो ऐसे Stock को कम से कम Next Quarter तक अपनी Watchlist में जरूर रखना चाहिए क्योंकि मार्केट Supreme हैं।

जो सबको पता होता है वह Advertisement होती हैं और जो किसी को न पता हो वह ही असली खबर होती हैं और आपको तो पता ही है मार्केट सब जानता है।

Ready To Hit 30 Fast 

Bharat Road Network Limited (BRNL), established in 2006 and based in Kolkata, is a specialized road and highway infrastructure developer operating under the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model. The company partners with experienced EPC firms to deliver, operate, and manage key transportation projects across India, focusing on connectivity, efficient project delivery, and sustainable growth.

Key Investment thesis
BRNL operates six BOT projects, covering approximately 2,095 lane km of national and state highways, bridges, and flyovers. This diversified operational portfolio underscores its strong execution capability and presence across multiple regions in India, supporting consistent revenue generation and operational experience in complex infrastructure projects.

The company emphasizes value unlocking through asset realignment, claim realization, and strategic monetization of completed projects. By optimizing its portfolio and focusing on claim settlements, BRNL aims to generate additional cash flows and improve returns for shareholders, positioning itself for future project cycles.

Governance is robust, with zero promoter pledge as of June 2025, and ongoing improvements in board and management structure. This commitment to transparency and sound governance practices builds investor confidence, enhances regulatory compliance, and supports BRNL’s long-term credibility in the infrastructure sector.

Debt reduction remains a priority, steadily improving the company’s financial health and balance sheet strength. Lower leverage provides operational flexibility and makes BRNL more competitive for new project bids, especially as infrastructure investment accelerates across India.

BRNL’s shares remain significantly undervalued, currently trading at a ~77% discount to estimated fair value. This deep value gap offers an attractive opportunity for long-term, value-oriented investors, particularly as the company’s turnaround efforts and sector tailwinds gain momentum.",0,0,3,13.333333333333334,20,1,1,0.0,0.0,1.0

अभी Result का Time चल रहा है और मैंने इस Quarter के Result का अपने स्तर पर एक विश्लेषण किया है जिसमें कुछ मेरे अनुभव-

💎 ज्यादातर Stocks जिनके Result बेहतर नहीं हैं वो Result से कुछ दिन पहले गिर जाते हैं और फिर रिजल्ट वाले दिन थोड़ा और DIP लेकर Strong Reversal दे देते हैं यदि वो अच्छे Support पर आ जाये तो 

💎 ज्यादातर Stocks जिनके Result बेहतरीन हैं वो Result से कुछ दिन पहले बढ़ जाते हैं और फिर रिजल्ट वाले दिन थोड़ा और Up जाकर Strong Reversal दे देते हैं यदि वो अच्छे Resistance से टकरा जाये 

💎 जो Stock Result से पहले किसी भी तरह का Move नहीं देता वो Result वाले दिन या अगले दिन Result के अनुसार ही Move देता है (जैसा रिजल्ट वैसा मूव)

💎 Result आने के बाद Option Premium (Call & Put दोनों) ही Melt हो जाते है सो Option Buying से बचना चाहिए।

आशा करता हूँ मेरे अनुभव आपके शायद काम आये यदि काम आये तो अपने दोस्तों को Share कर देना

PM draws the line amid US tariff heat, govt plans strategy for exporters**
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday declared that India would “never compromise” on the interests of its farmers, livestock rearers, and fishermen even if it meant pay­ing a “heavy personal price”, in a strong response to the United States doubling tariffs to 50 per cent on Indian exports. The Prime Minister’s statement signalled that New Delhi was unwilling to yield to Washington’s pressure for greater agricultural market access. The government, according to people familiar with the matter, is working on a three-pronged strategy to support exporters threatened by the tariff hike. One approach involves launching a sector-specific support scheme under the proposed ₹2,250 crore Export Promotion Mission. Another centres on diversifying export destinations away from the US. The third measure could see surplus products redirected to meet domestic demand if American orders decline. Speaking earlier at the M S Swaminathan Centenary International Conference, Modi said: “For us, the welfare of our farmers is of the highest priority. India will never compromise on the interests of its farmers, livestock rearers, and fishermen. And I am fully aware that I may have to pay a very heavy price personally, but I am prepared for it.” Talks between India and the US on an interim trade deal collapsed last month with disagreements over American dairy products and genetically modified crops proving insurmountable.

*Sebi may raise minimum block deal size, widen permissible price range*
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is considering a fresh round of reforms to its block deal framework, with proposals to raise the minimum trade size and widen the permissible price range, according to people familiar with the matter. The markets regulator, according to the sources, is weighing an increase in the minimum block deal size to ₹25 crore, from the current ₹10 crore, in a bid to channel smaller trades towards the regular cash market. The existing threshold was set in 2017, when Sebi last carried out a major overhaul of the framework.’ Another significant change under discussion concerns the price band for block deals. At present, trades can be executed within a 1 per cent band on either side of the previous day’s closing price. Sebi is understood to be considering a wider band of up to 3 per cent for non-derivative stocks, while retaining the 1 per cent band for futures and options (F&O) scrips to reduce the risk of market manipulation. A separate dispensation is also being examined for SME-listed stocks, the sources said. The proposals were discussed at a recent meeting between the regulator, stock exchanges, and other market participants. Sebi had earlier constituted a working group to review the block deal framework.

FirstCry is India’s largest multi-channel retailing platform for Mothers’, Babies’, and Kids’ products, in terms of GMV, for the year ending December 2023, according to the RedSeer Report, with a growing presence in select international markets. In India, they sell Mothers’, Babies’, and Kids’ products through their online platform, company-owned modern stores, franchisee-owned modern stores, and general trade retail distribution. 
They seek to develop a tangible, emotional, multi-year relationship with parents, especially mothers, with whom their first engagement begins from their baby’s conception (i.e., nine months before birth) and can continue until their child reaches about 12 years of age. According to the RedSeer Report, childcare is a non-discretionary, essential expense, for which there is perpetual need. They operate in a retail category with high purchase frequency, in which children outgrow clothing sizes quickly and need consumables such as diapers and other baby products along with other needs that evolve with age. Thus, once parents establish a connection with them, they are likely to start a predictable and frequent transactional journey of about twelve years as their children grow. 
 
 
They launched the FirstCry platform in India in 2010 to create a one-stop destination for parenting needs across commerce, content, community engagement, and education. They named their platform “FirstCry” because they believe that a baby’s first cry is a special moment for parents, and they aim to make such moments of the parenting journey filled with joy and happiness. 
They have expanded internationally in select markets, establishing a presence in UAE and KSA in 2019 and 2022 respectively, where they aim to replicate their India playbook. According to the RedSeer Report, they are the largest specialist online Mothers’, Babies’, and Kids’ Product retail platforms in UAE, in terms of GMV, for the year ending December 2023. Further, in KSA, they are the largest online-first Mothers’, Babies’ and Kids’ product-focused retail platform, according to the RedSeer Report. After the UAE, they aim to replicate our India playbook in KSA.",0,0,2,15.0,30,1,1,0.0,0.0,1.0

Don’t Panic. Here’s What You Need to Know 👇

Yes, NIFTY is opening deep in the red today—down 4–5%—triggered by global panic after Trump announced fresh tariffs. But before you let fear take over, let’s zoom out and look at the bigger picture. Macro indicators are quietly but firmly shifting in India’s favor.


🌏 MACRO OVERVIEW: Why India Still Stands Tall

1. DXY Falling 📉  
A weaker US Dollar supports emerging market currencies like the Indian Rupee 🇮🇳.  
- Cheaper imports (especially crude) → lower inflation  
- FIIs tend to pump more capital into Indian equities during dollar weakness

2. US Market Overvalued 🇺🇸  
- The US currently trades at historically high PE ratios  
- If global investors seek better value, India becomes a natural destination  
- Softer DXY + high US valuations = capital rotation into India

3. Crude Prices Cooling 🛢  
India imports ~80% of its oil. Lower prices mean:  
- Lower import bill  
- Better fiscal balance  
- Cooling inflation → gives RBI policy room

4. US 10-Year Yield Falling 📉 (US10Y)  
- Lower yields = unattractive US debt = FIIs look to India for better returns  
- Strengthens INR → reduces import-driven inflation  
- Easier global liquidity → positive for risk assets

5. Indian 10Y Yield Falling (IN10Y)  
- Indicates easing bias from RBI  
- Boosts rate-sensitive sectors: Banks, NBFCs, Autos  
- Government borrowing becomes cheaper → infrastructure push

6. Fitch Downgrades China 🇨🇳  
- Rising China risk = FII shift toward India  
- Reinforces India’s image as a stable, growth-focused EM destination

7. Precious Metals Cooling 🪙  
- Lower gold/silver prices reduce India’s import bill  
- Supports trade balance and boosts consumer sentiment  

8. RBI’s OMO Purchases 🏦  
- Injects liquidity → brings down yields → supports credit growth  
- Bullish for banks, NBFCs, and infrastructure

9. India’s Inflation Well Anchored  
- CPI at 4.31% (Jan 2025), lowest in months  
- RBI expects sub-4% inflation by Q4 FY25  
- Aided by food prices and proactive policy moves

✅ Bottom Line:

Today’s fall may look scary, but remember: markets react sharply to headlines, while macros move steadily in the background. And right now, those macros are favoring India.

🟠 Nifty 50**
Nifty opened with a **gap-up** but quickly faded to **fill the gap** in early trade. After taking **support at the gap-fill zone**, the index staged a **strong recovery**, reclaiming session highs by the close.

During a brief mid-session consolidation, **Nifty held VWAP multiple times**, reinforcing strength and leading to a **firm close**. Despite **volatile moves in Sensex options due to expiry**, Nifty remained **orderly and constructive**, setting up for tomorrow’s **monthly expiry**.
🔸 **Closing Level:** **22,535** (+374 pts)

**🟠 Bank Nifty**
Bank Nifty also saw a **sharp opening move**, which was quickly retraced as the index **filled the gap** and took support near the **20-day EMA**—a level that acted as resistance yesterday.

Post this move, the index remained **rangebound and volatile**, mimicking Nifty’s structure. While relatively sideways through the session, **Bank Nifty managed to close above the psychological 50,000 mark**, showing **strength ahead of the RBI policy event**.
🔸 **Closing Level:** **50,511** (+651 pts)

**🟠 Broader Markets**
Broader markets followed a similar path—**initial strength, midday volatility**, and a **positive close**. After two days of intense selling pressure, both **MidCap and SmallCap indices** showed signs of **absorption and resilience**.

The **advance-decline ratio was strongly positive**, with **452 stocks advancing vs. just 46 declining**, suggesting **broad-based recovery participation** across sectors.

On July 3, 2025, SEBI slammed a 105-page interim order on global trading giant Jane Street, accusing them of manipulating BANKNIFTY options using a sneaky intraday expiry-day play.


The playbook?

🕘 Morning: Pump the index up by aggressively buying BANKNIFTY stocks & futures

🕒 Afternoon: Dump it all, crash the index, and cash in on bearish option bets

💥 Just on Jan 17, 2024, they allegedly made ₹735 Cr doing this.

Between Jan ‘23 and Mar ‘25:
- ₹43,289 Cr made in index options

- ₹17,319 Cr from BANKNIFTY alone

- ₹7,687 Cr lost in stock futures and cash

 The math doesn’t lie.
🚨 Jan 17, 2024 highlights:


 ₹29K Cr traded in BANKNIFTY stocks
 ₹1 Cr Cr (yes, crore crore) traded in options
 4.6K traders in stocks vs 16.15L in options

A few whales moved the small pond (cash market) to ripple the ocean (options). SEBI didn’t like it.

SEBI’s charge?

 PFUTP violations
 Ignoring NSE warnings
 Continued expiry-day aggression

This is more than just one firm. It’s a wake-up call.


📌 Key takeaways for traders:

1. Expiry day ≠ fair play
2. Index moves ≠ always organic
3. Option pricing ≠ always clean

🧠 My view:
This might be a turning point in India's F\&O evolution. We need tighter guardrails before foreign algos turn expiry days into circus acts.

Markets grow on trust. Let’s keep it that way.

✅ जब भगवान कृष्ण के हस्तिनापुर के मैत्री प्रस्ताव को ठुकराकर कौरवों ने यह बात स्पष्ट कर दी थी कि अब युद्ध तो होकर ही रहेगा तब भगवान कृष्ण ने निष्पक्ष होकर एक साइड खुद को रखा और दूसरी साइड अपनी अक्षौहिणी सेना (जिसमें लाखों पैदल सैनिक,घोड़े,हाथी आदि थे) कौरवों ने अक्षौहिणी सेना को वहीं पाण्डवों ने श्रीकृष्ण को चुना और युद्ध का परिणाम आप सभी को मालूम ही है कि कौन विजित हुआ ।

𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙘𝙠 𝙈𝙖𝙧𝙠𝙚𝙩 में हमारे पास यदि दो 𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙘𝙠𝙨 हैं जिसमें से पहले की 𝙋𝙧𝙞𝙘𝙚 24 𝙍𝙪𝙥𝙚𝙚 है (𝙁𝙪𝙣𝙙𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙖𝙡 कमजोर हैं यदि) और दूसरे की 𝙋𝙧𝙞𝙘𝙚 2400 (𝙁𝙪𝙣𝙙𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙖𝙡 𝙎𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣𝙜) है और हमारे पास यदि 24,000 हजार रुपये हैं तो हममे से ज्यादातर लोग 24 𝙍𝙪𝙥𝙚𝙚 वाले 𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙘𝙠 को ही चुनेंगे लेकिन सनद रहे यदि दोनों ही 10% 𝙐𝙋 होंगे तो 𝙋𝙧𝙤𝙛𝙞𝙩 2400 ही होगा और यदि दोनों 10% 𝘿𝙊𝙒𝙉 होंगे तो भी 𝙇𝙊𝙎𝙎 2400 ही होगा लेकिन 24 रुपये वाले 𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙘𝙠 वालों को नींद नहीं आयेगी की यार इसके 𝙁𝙪𝙣𝙙𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙖𝙡 सही नहीं है यार ऐसा न हो जाये यार वैसा न हो जाये जबकि 2400 रुपये वाले 𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙘𝙠 जिन्होंने लिया है उन्हें पता है 𝙁𝙪𝙣𝙙𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙖𝙡 बढ़िया है इसको और 𝘿𝙄𝙋 में 𝘼𝘿𝘿 करेंगे ।

यदि सरल शब्दों में कहें--

𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙘𝙠 𝙈𝙖𝙧𝙠𝙚𝙩 में भी हम संख्या बल पर हमेशा 𝙁𝙤𝙘𝙪𝙨 करते हैं जैसे कौरवों ने किया था अक्षौहिणी सेना को चुनकर,हमें चुनना चाहिये पांडवों की तरह 𝙌𝙪𝙖𝙡𝙞𝙩𝙮 से भरपूर श्रीकृष्ण को जो देर सबेर हमें युद्ध में विजयी बनाने के लिए प्रेरित करेंगे । तो संख्या के फेर में न पड़ें 𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙘𝙠 𝙈𝙖𝙧𝙠𝙚𝙩 में अपने श्रीकृष्ण को चुने

✅ भगवान राम और कृष्ण दोनों ही भगवान विष्णु के अवतार हैं लेकिन आप बहुत गौर से देखगे की भगवान राम जहाँ मर्यादाओं का पालन कर मर्यादा पुरुषोत्तम हैं वहीं भगवान कृष्ण 𝙍𝙪𝙡𝙚𝙨 को तोड़कर भी अपने जीवन में उत्कृष्ट कर रहें है..

आप 𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙘𝙠 𝙈𝙖𝙧𝙠𝙚𝙩 में या जीवन के किसी भी क्षेत्र में एक बात याद रखें जरूरी नहीं आप पूरे रूल्स फॉलो करके ही बेहतर कर सकते हैं कुछ रूल्स तोड़कर भी आप अपना 𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝘽𝙚𝙨𝙩 कर सकते हैं । जब स्कूल में था तो कुछ लोग बोलते थे सुबह जल्दी उठकर पढ़ना चाहिए लेकिन कुछ लोग इस रूल को ब्रेक करके भी अपना द बेस्ट करते हैं यदि आप 𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙘𝙠 𝙈𝙖𝙧𝙠𝙚𝙩 में है तो कई लोग आपसे बोलेंगे की बगैर 𝙏𝙚𝙘𝙝𝙣𝙞𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙨 के पैसा नहीं बनेगा लेकिन 𝙄𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙩𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨/𝙊𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙤𝙧 आपको लगता है कि चार्ट देखते होंगे या वो ही चार्ट बनाते हैं ?? 

खैर कहने का मतलब है कि जरूरी नहीं आप किसी चीज़ के लिए सारे ही 𝙁𝙤𝙡𝙡𝙤𝙬 करें कुछ 𝙍𝙪𝙡𝙚𝙨 तोड़कर भी 𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝘽𝙚𝙨𝙩 कर सकते हैं जैसे भगवान कृष्ण ने अपने जीवन में किया ।

आपने भगवान श्रीकृष्ण से क्या सीखा अपने जीवन में जरूर बतायें.. बाकी पोस्ट अच्छी लगी हो तो ज्यादा से ज्यादा शेयर करें..

कृष्ण जन्माष्टमी की अनन्त-अशेष शुभकामनाएं आप अपने जीवन में उत्तरोत्तर उन्नति करें..

हमारे ईधर (बुंदेलखंड में) कृष्ण जन्माष्टमी को कन्हैया आठें भी कहते हैं तो भैया हरो कन्हैया आठें की भी शुभकामनाएं 😄

Market मेरी नज़र में (Nifty,Midcap & Smallcap) से मिलकर बना हैं लेकिन इसमें Stock's से ज्यादा अहम भूमिका Sectors कि होती है जो कि Stocks का Combination ही होता है।

कुछ ध्यान देने योग्य चीज़े-- 

✔️ यदि Sector Support/Breakout पर है और Stock भी अच्छे Support या Breakout पर है तो उसके चलने कि Probability बढ़ जाती है।

✔️ यदि Sector Resistance/Breakdown पर है और Stock भी अच्छे Resistance या Breakdown Level पर है तो उसके गिरने कि Probability बढ़ जाती है।

✔️ Market Support+Sector Support+RSI+EMA Support= High Probability Trade 

शेयर जरूर कर देना दोस्तों के साथ--

There comes a point in trading where too much information hurts.

You must put what you know into practice, a plan, something concrete you can test, verify, and validate.

If you're not getting the results you want, take a step back and work with what you have—not add more.

जब भी बहुत सारे Major Index Make Or Break लेवल के पास हो उस समय Bearish View नहीं बनाना चाहिए Wait करना चाहिए Confirmation का नहीं तो Sharp Bounce आपको बहुत नुकसान करवा सकता है।

यदि आप Option Buyer हैं तो हमेशा याद रखें की प्रीमियम पर इन 4 चीज़ों से बहुत Effect होता हैं 

1- Delta 
2- Theta 
3- Vega
4- Gama 

लेकिन इसमें सबसे Important हैं Theta जिसे हम Time Decay भी कह सकते हैं जैसे जैसे Expiry नज़दीक आती है Time Decay तेज़ी से होता हैं और Time Decay Option Buyer का दुश्मन होता है-

मेरे अनुभव से--

Best Time For Option Buyer 
5-15 Calander Date 
Best Time For Option Seller
16-5 Calendar Date

शुरुआत में Theta Decay का Effect ज्यादा नहीं होता लेकिन जैसे ही Month End होने लगता हैं तो यह Effect बहुत तेज़ी से बढ़ जाता है।

I Hope कुछ Learn किया होगा।

जिस Month में भी Weekly & Monthly Closing साथ हो साथ ही Index Make Or Break Level पर हो तो ऐसी Condition में हमेशा उस Weekly & Monthly Closing का Wait करना चाहिए क्योंकि गेम किसी भी साइड हो सकता हैं।

Open होते समय किसी के फेवर में और Closing के समय किसी के फेवर में इसलिए धैर्य ही सबसे अच्छा विकल्प है।

क्योंकि Trading में हमें हमेशा Opportunity Find करनी होती हैं Create नहीं करनी होती है।

Sell Very Poor Fundamental 🚀🚀

Stock Price Crash:

The stock has fallen over 55% from its 52-week high, reflecting massive erosion of investor confidence and poor market sentiment.

Overvaluation at Current Price:
Despite weak financials, the stock is still trading at a high P/E of ~52× and a Price-to-Book ratio of ~5×, much higher than industry peers, indicating it remains overvalued.

Flat Revenue Growth:
The company’s sales growth is almost stagnant, with a CAGR of only 0.8% over the past five years, showing no significant business expansion.

Weak Profit Margins:
Operating margins are low at ~8.5%, and net profit margin is only ~3.3%, which signals poor cost efficiency and low profitability.

Low Return Ratios: cash 
Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) are modest, averaging 10–13%, which is underwhelming for a company commanding a premium valuation.

Negative/Weak Cash Flows:
Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation is poor or negative in recent years, which means the company is not converting profits into real cash returns for shareholders.

High Debt Levels:
The debt-to-equity ratio is around 1.23×, indicating high financial leverage and exposure to interest rate or refinancing risks.

Promoter Pledging:
Around 8.8% of promoter holding is pledged, which raises concerns about promoter confidence and potential liquidity stress.

Poor Dividend Payout:
The company pays less than 3% of its profits as dividends, offering minimal returns to long-term investors.

Valuation Not Supported by Fundamentals:
With stagnant revenues, low margins, and limited growth prospects, the current valuation multiples are not justified by operational performance.**",0,1,0,50.0,50,1,1,0.0,1.0,0.0

Despite weak financials, the stock is still trading at a high P/E of ~52× and a Price-to-Book ratio of ~5×, much higher than industry peers, indicating it remains overvalued.

Flat Revenue Growth:
The company’s sales growth is almost stagnant, with a CAGR of only 0.8% over the past five years, showing no significant business expansion.

Weak Profit Margins:
Operating margins are low at ~8.5%, and net profit margin is only ~3.3%, which signals poor cost efficiency and low profitability.

Low Return Ratios: cash 
Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) are modest, averaging 10–13%, which is underwhelming for a company commanding a premium valuation.

Negative/Weak Cash Flows:
Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation is poor or negative in recent years, which means the company is not converting profits into real cash returns for shareholders.

High Debt Levels:
The debt-to-equity ratio is around 1.23×, indicating high financial leverage and exposure to interest rate or refinancing risks.

Promoter Pledging:
Around 8.8% of promoter holding is pledged, which raises concerns about promoter confidence and potential liquidity stress.

Poor Dividend Payout:
The company pays less than 3% of its profits as dividends, offering minimal returns to long-term investors.

Valuation Not Supported by Fundamentals:
With stagnant revenues, low margins, and limited growth prospects, the current valuation multiples are not justified by operational performance.**",0,1,0,50.0,50,1,1,0.0,1.0,0.0

US doubles tariff on India to 50% over Russian crude oil purchases**
In a significant escalation of trade tensions, the Donald Trump administration on Wednesday imposed a further 25 per cent tariff on Indian exports to the United States (US), blaming New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian crude oil. The move brings the total tariff burden to 50 per cent, leaving India at a marked disadvantage compared to global competitors, including China, on virtually all merchandise exports to the US. The US had already announced a 25 per cent tariff on Indian imports, set to come into force from August 7. The additional 25 per cent duty will apply to shipments arriving after a 21-day window, from August 28 onwards. These tariffs are being levied on top of existing World Trade Organization-compatible duties. “I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to impose an additional ad valorem duty on imports of articles of India, which is directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil,” Trump said in an executive order issued by the White House. The order states that India’s continued oil trade with Russia undermines US national security and foreign policy interests, particularly in relation to the conflict in Ukraine. India has condemned the tariff hike, calling the US decision “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable” and emphasising how the US in recent days “targeted” India’s oil imports from Russia.

- **Revenue & Growth:** Q2 revenue grew 8.6% YoY, slightly below expectations due to customer decision delays. Five of six verticals posted YoY growth. Financial Services grew 16% YoY; banking rebounded 13.5% QoQ. Manufacturing & Consumer declined 11.5% YoY due to macro headwinds. Asia Pacific expected to accelerate with SMC acquisition. Full-year growth guidance revised down, but $3bn revenue ambition for CY29 intact.

- **Profitability & Margins:** EBITDA margin at 17.2%, within guided 17.1%-17.4%. One-offs resulted in modest ~15bps margin impact including earnout reversal, impairment, restructuring costs, and provisions. Utilization improved to 83.7%, offshore revenue increased by 110bps QoQ. Attrition remains low. ERP transformation costs taper but continue into H2.

- **Strategic Acquisition – SMC Squared:** Provides entry into the growing GCC (Global Capability Center) setup market in India (~1,700 GCCs), with expansion opportunities in Europe and LATAM. SMC revenue $22 million last year; acquisition EPS accretive day one. SMC complements Hexaware’s AI and transformation capabilities.

- **Geographic Expansion:** Robust Middle East pipeline; new customer experience center opened in Chicago. Expansion plans continue in India and globally.

- **Client and Deal Wins:** Added one new $50M+ client, maintaining broad-based growth. Key wins include AI-driven product development, cloud migration, and Salesforce implementations.

- **Market & Industry:** Current slowdown is cyclical and macro-driven, not structural or AI-related. Vendor consolidation ongoing, causing deal delays. GCC growth viewed as an opportunity.

- **Guidance & Outlook:** Growth expectations for CY25 revised downward due to macro issues; Q3 expected to improve QoQ. Margin guidance remains steady. Wage hikes implemented in July at moderated levels. Hiring at upper guided range continues.

- **Management Tone:** Confident in long-term growth and strategy execution despite short-term headwinds. ERP benefits expected by year-end. No further provisions expected on impaired European client.",0,0,1,20.0,20,1,1,0.0,0.0,1.0

Amid a flurry of engagement between the Brics’ founding members following US President Donald Trump’s latest round of tariffs, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will meet his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on August 21. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is also expected in India next week for talks on the boundary dispute with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, under the special representatives’ mechanism between the neighbours. India has yet to officially confirm either visit. However, on Wednesday afternoon the Russian foreign ministry announced the Jaishankar–Lavrov meeting, saying it would cover bilateral relations and “aspects of cooperation within international frameworks”. The two are also expected to finalise dates for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to India later this year. Government sources in New Delhi said Wang’s trip, possibly as early as August 18, had been in the works. Alongside efforts to advance de-escalation between the two militaries, the meeting could pave the way for a bilateral between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin from August 31 to September 1. It would be Modi’s first visit to China in seven years. Wang and Doval are the designated special representatives for boundary talks. Doval visited China in December last year for discussions with Wang, following a thaw agreed by Modi and Xi in Kazan on October 24, 2024.

Govt seeks to revamp entire tax system with GST reform, Income-Tax Bill**
The central government’s proposal for a structural overhaul of the goods and services tax (GST), along with the Income-Tax Bill recently passed by Parliament, will lead to a complete revamp of both the direct and indirect tax system in the country, said a senior government official. “This is a complete revamp of the direct and indirect tax system. It will take the GST Council at least two meetings to go through all the item-wise changes in slabs. The inclusion of petrol and diesel under GST has been deferred for the time being in view of the prevailing energy sector uncertainties. It may be taken up in the next round of GST reforms,” the official said, requesting anonymity. The Centre has proposed a two-tier GST with 5 per cent and 18 per cent slabs, along with a 40 per cent slab for a few items in the sin goods category. The removal of the compensation cess will coincide with the rationalised and reduced rates. Further simplification of the input tax credit system will be undertaken as part of this round of GST reform. Capacity building by way of strength­ening GST tribunals is also in the works. If endorsed by all states, the proposal — being examined by the Group of Ministers (GoM) for rate rationalisation headed by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary — will lead to the abolition of the existing 12 per cent and 28 per cent slabs in the GST. While inaugurating two major national highway projects worth ₹11,000 crore on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Centre had circulated the draft of the next-generation GST reforms among states and sought their cooperation to implement the proposal before Diwali. “For us, reform means the expansion of good governance,” Modi said, adding that several major reforms would be introduced in the coming days to make both life and business easier.

*Govt set to log out real-money games; Bill to be tabled on Wednesday*
The government has finalised a draft legislation to ban all forms of online real-money gaming (RMG) in India and will introduce it in Parliament on Wednesday. The draft Bill, cleared by the Union Cabinet on Tuesday, is likely to bar “offering, aiding, abetting, inducing, or otherwise in the offering of any online money gaming service and declares it as an offence”, according to a person in the know. Aimed at curbing the sharp spike in online gaming addiction among children and youth that has triggered mental health issues and financial losses, the Bill also bans any person and advertisement from promoting online money games. Furthermore, the draft Bill has also proposed that banks, financial institutions, or any other person should not facilitate any transactions related to online real-money games, the sources said. According to the Lok Sabha’s updated list of business for Wednesday, the “Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025” is scheduled for introduction. The development has taken the industry by surprise, with several executives terming it a death knell for the online real gaming sector.

*Foreign investors slash India allocations in July, shift to China & Korea*
India is rapidly losing favour with global emerging market (EM) investors, with the latest fund flow data showing one of the steepest cutbacks in allocations to Indian equities in recent months. According to an analysis done by Nomura of 45 large EM funds, relative allocations to India fell by 110 basis points (bps) month-on-month (M-o-M) in July, with as many as 41 funds reducing exposure. This marks India out as the largest underweight (UW) market in EM portfolios, with allocations standing at a negative 2.9 percentage points relative to benchmark MSCI EM index. In contrast, Hong Kong, China and South Korea have emerged as the key beneficiaries of this regional rebalancing. Allocations to Hong Kong, China and South Korea rose by 80 bps, 70 bps and 40 bps, respectively, reflecting a decisive rotation in foreign portfolios. In the Nomura sample set, 37 of the 45 funds increased their exposure to Hong Kong and China while 29 did so in case of South Korea. The tilt is significant as it comes at a time when India continues to trade at a valuation premium to EM peers. By the end of July, 71 per cent of EM funds were underweight on India, up from 60 per cent in June. In comparison, the percentage of funds underweight on Hong Kong, China, dropped sharply from 71 per cent in June to 53 per cent in July, suggesting sentiment towards Chinese equities is turning less bearish. South Korea, meanwhile, has moved into overweight territory, with 60 per cent of EM funds now overweight versus a more balanced split previously.

*PM Modi and Xi Jinping vow to stabilise world trade, boost investment ties*
With both India and China facing the economic fallout from the US trade war, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday agreed that their countries’ economies could help stabilise world trade. They also underlined the need to approach bilateral trade and investment ties from a political and strategic perspective to reduce the trade deficit. At their second meeting in less than a year, on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, Xi told Modi that achieving a “dragon-elephant dance” is the right choice for the two neighbors. Modi said maintaining peace and tranquility at the border is like an insurance policy for India-China ties. However, Xi emphasized that China-India relations should not be defined merely by the boundary issue. Modi added, with Xi agreeing, that India and China are partners, not adversaries, with far more consensus than differences. The two leaders agreed that their differences should not turn into disputes. Later, in an evening briefing to the media, India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri alluded to the tariff war unleashed by Washington, observing that the two leaders recognised the situation and saw potential to “leverage” it to build greater understanding between the countries, especially to advance commercial ties.

*PV sales decline 7% in August as buyers await GST rate cut decision*
Domestic passenger-vehicle (PV) sales by companies to dealers dropped 7.3 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) in August to around 330,000 units, primarily due to customers waiting for a decision by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council on September 4 on decreasing the tax on automobiles from 28 per cent to 18 per cent. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL), India’s largest carmaker, recorded a drop of 7.5 per cent Y-o-Y to 144,145 units. Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer (marketing and sales), said in August the company calibrated its dispatches in accordance with demand from consumers. “Till August 15, there was good traction in terms of bookings,” he said in a press conference. In his Independence Day address, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the GST structure would be streamlined with just two main tax slabs (5 per cent and 18 per cent) plus a higher bracket (of 40 per cent) for luxury or harmful items. This will effectively replace the four-tier structure currently in place. The GST Council will hold its meeting on September 3 and 4 on rate rationalisation. Automobiles come under 28 per cent and are expected to go to 18 per cent slab. “Once GST reforms are announced, we expect good sales,” Banerjee noted.

Here are the reasons mentioned below –
**1. US Recession fears**
Fears of a looming recession in the US have given a severe jolt to the risk appetite of investors globally after July payroll data last Friday showed the US unemployment rate jumped to near a three-year high of 4.3 per cent last month against 4.1 per cent in June. July marked the fourth consecutive monthly increase in the unemployment rate.

**2. Rising tensions in the Middle East**
According to media reports, Iran has vowed to take revenge after Israel killed Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh. Haniyeh was killed when he was in Iran to attend the inauguration of newly elected Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.

As Mint reported earlier, the rising threats and provocative actions from both sides have heightened fears of an imminent war. The United States is reinforcing its military presence in the region in response to the escalating situation.

Investors across the globe are keenly observing the evolving situation. If the war escalates from the current levels, it will be hit market sentiment strongly.
**3. Stretched valuation**
The Indian stock market's current valuation is stretched and experts say the market is ripe for a healthy correction.
Valuations in India, driven mainly by sustained liquidity flows, continue to be high, particularly in the mid and small-cap segments. The overvalued segments of the market, like defence and railways, are likely to come under pressure.

**4. Unimpressive Q1 result**
India Inc.'s June quarter (Q1FY25) result has been mixed and failed to cheer market sentiment. As the current market valuation remains high, experts fear the earnings may not be able to sustain it.
The rally in the recent past has been supported by earnings growth, but experts see some moderation in the earnings of several sectors, which has potentially triggered some profit booking in the market.",0,1,0,40.0,40,1,1,0.0,1.0,0.0

SEBI Chairperson Involvement in Adani Money Siphoning Scandal – 
Summary – 
• Whistleblower Documents Show That Madhabi Buch, The Current Chairperson Of SEBI, And Her Husband Had Stakes In Both Obscure Offshore Funds Used In The Adani Money Siphoning Scandal. The current SEBI Chairperson and her husband, Dhaval Buch, had hidden stakes in the exact same obscure offshore Bermuda and Mauritius funds, found in the same complex nested structure, used by Vinod Adani. 
• Despite the existence of thousands of mainstream, reputable onshore Indian Mutual fund products, an industry she now is responsible for regulating, documents show SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Buch and her husband had stakes in a multi-layered offshore fund structure with miniscule assets, traversing known high-risk jurisdictions, overseen by a company with reported ties to the Wirecard scandal, in the same entity run by an Adani director and significantly used by Vinod Adani in the alleged Adani cash siphoning scandal. 
• To Date, SEBI Has Taken No Action Against Other Suspect Adani Shareholders Operated By India Infoline: EM Resurgent Fund and Emerging India Focus Funds 
SEBI chairperson involvement in promoting Blackstone’s REITS. 
• During Dhaval Buch’s (SEBI Chairperson Husband) Time As Advisor To Blackstone, SEBI Has Proposed, Approved And Facilitated Major REIT Regulations Changes. Since Madhabi Buch became Chairperson in March 2022, SEBI has proposed and implemented a raft of REIT legislation, of significant benefit to Blackstone as one of the largest REIT sponsors in India, whom her husband works for. 
• SEBI chairperson Herself Promoted REIT’s as her “Favourite products for the Future” and urged investors to look “Positively:” upon the asset class. While Making Those Statements, She Omitted To Mention That Blackstone, Who Her Husband Advises, Stands To Gain Significantly From The Asset Class. 
 
Conclusion from the report above – 
Hindenburg suggest that SEBI can not be trusted as an objective arbiter in Adani matter, as the SEBI chairperson has allegedly having stake in Adani group of companies.
